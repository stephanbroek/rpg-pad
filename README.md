rpg-pad
=======

The goal for this project is to make it easier to create and play RPGs by having better 
character sheets which are more easily editable and important information shared between
party members and to the GM.

All there to make it easier to play and less time trying to make and maintain characters.

planned features
--------
- a pathfinder character sheet which is completely fillable
- Player name, Character name, Class, Race and HP shared with everyone
- Character sheets from all players shared with the GM
- All things live update between browsers connected to the same game
- Notes which are shared between a every one, a player and the GM and completely 
  private notes
- links embedable in all places to help keep track of rules


later stage features
------
Nice to have but will require quite a bit of effort so will be done once a working product 
has been made:

- race and class will autocomplete and will automatically fill in appropriate fields
- common feats, spells and other such stuff will autocomplete
- Level up button which will allow for quick levelups.
- Other character sheets for other RPG formats


Lots of other things will obviously be made aswell but for now these are the main features 
I'm looking at from the start.
