The goal for this project is to make it easier to create and play RPGs 
by having better character sheets which are more easily editable and 
important information shared betweenparty members and to the GM.

All there to make it easier to play and less time trying to make and 
maintain characters.

A current copy is running on http://rpg-pad.mneme.me/ not functional 
yet but you can see the current code in action there

planned features
--------
- a pathfinder character sheet which is completely fillable
- Player name, Character name, Class, Race and HP shared with everyone
- Character sheets from all players shared with the GM
- All things live update between browsers connected to the same game
- Notes which are shared between a every one, a player and the GM and 
  completely private notes
- links embedable in all places to help keep track of rules


later stage features
------
Nice to have but will require quite a bit of effort so will be done 
once a working product has been made:

- race and class will autocomplete and will automatically fill in 
  appropriate fields
- common feats, spells and other such stuff will autocomplete
- Level up button which will allow for quick levelups.
- Other character sheets for other RPG formats


Lots of other things will obviously be made aswell but for now these 
are the main features I'm looking at from the start.
